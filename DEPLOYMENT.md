5. Set start command: `npm start`
6. Add environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`
7. Deploy

## 🔧 Environment Variables

All platforms require the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable:

| Platform | How to Set                               |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Vercel   | Project Settings → Environment Variables |
| Netlify  | Site Settings → Environment Variables    |
| Railway  | Variables tab in dashboard               |
| Render   | Environment tab in dashboard             |

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, test these features:

1. **Text Chat**: Type a question and verify AI response
2. **Voice Input**: Click microphone and speak a question
3. **Voice Output**: Verify text-to-speech works
4. **Mobile**: Test on mobile devices

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"OpenAI API key not configured"**

   - Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your deployment platform
   - Check that the key is valid and has credits

2. **Voice recording not working**

   - Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for microphone access)
   - Check browser permissions for microphone

3. **Build fails**
   - Ensure Node.js 18+ is used
   - Check that all dependencies are installed

### Debug Steps

1. Check deployment logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test API endpoints directly
4. Check browser console for client-side errors

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

The app is already optimized for mobile with:

- Responsive design
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Mobile-optimized voice recording
- Progressive Web App features

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **API Key Security**: Never expose your OpenAI API key in client-side code
2. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for production
3. **CORS**: Configure CORS if needed for your domain

## 📊 Monitoring

Consider adding monitoring for:

- API usage and costs
- Error rates
- User engagement
- Performance metrics

## 🎉 Success!

Once deployed, your voice bot will be:

- ✅ Accessible to anyone with a web browser
- ✅ No installation required
- ✅ Works on desktop and mobile
- ✅ Powered by ChatGPT API
- ✅ Real speech-to-text and text-to-speech
